## Workflow Optimization

- Work in small, focused tasks; confirm each change before stacking more.
- Reference UI by target names from `UI_TARGETS.md` to avoid ambiguity.
- Provide a short acceptance criteria line ("done when...") for UI changes.
- Keep `WORK_LOG.json` updated after changes and include a short last-known state note when behavior is tricky.
- Prefer incremental renders and avoid full tree re-renders when possible for UI performance.
